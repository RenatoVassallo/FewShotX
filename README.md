# FewShotX

FewShotX is a Python package for zero-shot and few-shot learning, designed for text classification and Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks. The package provides flexible and intuitive classes to implement custom learning approaches using minimal labeled data.

## üöÄ Features

* **DictionaryScorer**: A scoring based on word-counting methods.
* **ZeroShotLearner**: Leverages embedding-based similarity to classify text without labeled training data.
* **ZeroShotNLI**: Applies Natural Language Inference for entailment, contradiction, and neutral detection.
* **FewShotLearner**: Implements few-shot learning with support for training on a limited number of labeled examples.

## üì¶ Installation

Install the latest version:

```bash
pip install https://github.com/RenatoVassallo/FewShotX/releases/download/0.1.3/fewshotx-0.1.3-py3-none-any.whl
```
